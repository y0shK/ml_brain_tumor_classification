# Comparison of ML Methods for Brain Tumor Classification

## Description
This project is the final project in my Machine Learning class. The research problem is as follows. Given an input MRI scan, develop an algorithm to distinguish benign tumors (meningioma) from malignant tumors (glioma). The dataset comes from a Kaggle dataset of MRI scans, linked below. After extracting the dataset, pixel intensity of the MRI scans is fed in as a feature to various ML models (rbf kernel SVM, linear SVM, logistic regression, K-neighbors, and random forest). Finally, an ensemble model is used to aggregate the individual performance metrics.
